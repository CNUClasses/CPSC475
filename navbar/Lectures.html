                Long running task on the UI thread cause a non-responsive UI and a probable 'Application not responding (ANR) error.<br>
                Therefore all long running tasks should take place on a separate thread.  See below projects for ANR demo<br>
                <br>
                Threads that are non-static inner classes of an activity hold an implicit reference to their enclosing activity which prevents the activity from being garbage collected when the device is rotated and the activity is torn down and recreated.<br>
                Fix this problem by making the threads static inner classes<br>
                <br>
                A larger problem is what happens to a thread when the device is rotated? If a thread trys to use a reference to a widget in the activity that is being destroyed it triggers a null pointer exception.<br>
                Fix this by attaching and detaching a parent activity to a thread when needed.  But we are back to holding a reference to the activity and some very fussy code to get right.  Plus there is tight coupling between the thread and the activity

                 what happens when device rotates while thread is running, an attempt to ensure thread contains reference to valid activity by hosting thread in a singleton, and demonstrates why there are still synchronization issues<br>

                 Using the singleton to manage UI button state while activity is torn down and recreated<br>
                 Using a weak reference (substitute Updatetask_with_weakref for UpdateTask)<br>
                 <br>
                 But none of these methods will work well, for example in UpdateTask, run method, what if act is detached and GCed between checking if act is null and dereferencing act? You crash.  You can synchronize this to ensure this does not happen but then you hold on to a destroyed activity just to manipulate no longer visible UI. A Weak reference is worse since there is no wy to synchronize with the GC.<br>

                Using this method you don't have to worry about leaking the activity when its destroyed since threads no longer hold a reference to it.  The android framework manages all state adjustments associated with Activity configuration changes. 
                <br>This operates much like a preference change listener which is notified when a change is made to a preference in a preference activity.<br/>
